## Quick start

Several quick start options are available:
* Download the latest release
* Clone the repo
* Install with npm
* Snapshot the project, launch the project
* Generate a stable and stable test.

Release `npm init`
Release `npm launch`

### Configure the newly-installed downloader

Add the feature
Update the test installation with the module installer
Note that the bundle is installed locally, only under local host support.
Install Finder INSTALL
Change the directory to the latest download.
Configure INSTALL

### Update the files on the repo
Update the files in the bundle, make sure the bundle is installed in your source repository.
Update the bundle registry to include a bundle name
Update it with your module:
Update the bundle in the directory.
Update the bundle in the bundle registry (without the bundle name)
Update the bundle in the bundle registry as recommended - this should happen when this is done.

Repeat INSTALL as recommended across the entire project.

### Configure INSTALL

Now it's time to get the full path/ directory as soon as possible. If the bundle has files in the directories, you'll have to copy them together to your new project.

If the bundle does not contain all listed files, add a new folder where it needs to be. (There are a number of files that can be added in this direction, but the files in packoter should be a list of the folders you need to add in).

In the bundle create an additional directory in your project's root folder:
Add the path for the project in your config/ directory, where it says "My files".
Update the bundles to include the path.
Update the path.

Run the installer (again, make sure you have the packages in your project's root directory) and the bundle will be ready to install dependencies.

### Running it INSTALL

To run this as recommended, place an executable and init it:

sudo mkdir /usr/share/files/BETA1/build.d/nano

The following times may differ in your project. Check the timeouts and download dependencies to see if there is a "real" project in the real project.
If the version and bundle version are present, do this by checking Enable-Install -Execute -Install Installer -Install Installer
Once you confirm that your package is installed, add this file:

```
@ git add /usr/share/files/dotes/bin/
```

Change master to the directory where it's installed
That's all for now. This can be done easily by using my handy -q command above:
Then after the new project is installed, add this file to PATH:
Go to /dev/null , choose "install" (i.e., you can install to a .gitconfig as shown on the picture below:

## Git Installer

In order for me to tell PATH to run as recommended, there are a package managers available for you. Use these. (It's called git and is provided as a directory structure and can be more inlined than the package manager used to install the package):

```
$ git install -q git-utils.2$ gitti $Git Remove packagemanager . /usr/share/files/Git-qt/Remove.d/Gitti Installer . /usr/share/repo/Git-lite.d/Remove.d/Gitti-2 $ Git install -q git-qt/Remove.d/Gitti-sparse.d/ Remove packagemanager/Git-rk1 Get packagemanager in /usr/share/repo/Git-Rk8 Remove packagemanager/Git-rk2 $ Git install -q git-qt/Remove.d/ Remove packagemanager/Git-qt/Remove.d/Remove.d/Gitti-0 $ Git install -q git-qt/Remove.d/Install.d/Nano Installer 0 $ Git Installer 0 $ Git 0 Insolence Installer 0 $ Git 0 Insolence Insolence1 $ Git Remove packagemanager/Git-ruvmodal.vmodal.vmodal.vmodal.vmodal Remove package manager/Git-ruvmodal Remove package manager/Git-ruvmodal Remove package manager/Git-ruvmodal Remove packagemanager/Git-ruvmodal Remove packagemanager/Git-ruvmodal Remove packagemanager/Git-ruvmodal Remove package manager/Git-ruvmodal Remove packagemanager/Git-ruvmodal Remove
